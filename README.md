# ZenOS

ZenOS is a minimal educational operating system built from scratch for the x86_64 architecture.

The goal of this project is to understand how an operating system works at the lowest level:
 - booting
 - memory management
 - interrupts
 - multitasking
 - user/kernel separation.

This OS is built using C and x86 assembly, runs on bare metal, and is tested using QEMU.
